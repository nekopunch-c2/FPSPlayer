# FPSPlayer
This is a full-body first person player for Unity. It's coded using a hierarchical state machine. It currently has 7 superstates and 3 substates, as well as some stuff outside the state machine like camera movement. All three substates are accessible when the superstates are active. In other words,
you can walk, run or be idle while you are in any of the superstates, for example the grounded superstate.
# To be implemented
In the works are more states, such as swimming and more advanced movement, as well as IK features.
